- Design:

Suppose the services have dependencies between each other, e.g., to provide service 1,
you must first provide service 2, 3. Any platform must satisfy the service dependencies, 
but the applications do not need to explicitly specify the required services and all their
dependencies. 

This is an analog to the plugins of Eclipse platforms.

- Implementation:
ServiceDependencies: Generate dependencies between services, as a DAG
MutualisticGraph (changed): when creating platforms, make sure all to satisfy the dependency.

- Configuration:
Configuration::NDEP: How may links to create between services

- Results:
NDEP=0: Same as original experiment
NDEP is low: it seems that that the curve goes down a bit more quickly (not very sure...)
NDEP is high: from smooth curve to staircase curve. Probably because the platforms are 
homogenized
