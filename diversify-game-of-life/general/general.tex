\title{Dissimilarity between Platforms}

\maketitle

\section{Definition of Dissimilarity}

We suppose how the two platforms are similar to each other is also a measure to the diversity of the whole systems. If two platforms provide exactly the same set of services, then we could say that they are the same, and the \emph{dissimilarity} between them is 0. Otherwise, if they provide completely different sets of services, the dissimilarity is ultimate, say 1. We try to avoid using \emph{diversity} here because we have the feeling that merely the difference between platforms (or species) do not really mean diversity...

So the dissimilarity between a pair of platforms is defined as follows.

\[
	\dissim(p_1, p_2) = 1 - \frac{\left|p_1.ser \cap p_2.ser\right| }{\left|p_1.ser \cup p_2.ser\right| }
\]

The dissimilarity of the whole system is the average dissimilarity of every pair of platforms.

\[\dissim(P) = \frac{\sum_{p_1,p_2 \in P}\dissim(p_1, p_2)}{\left| P \right| * (\left| P \right|-1)}\]


\section{Experiment Design}

Two experiments:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
\textbf{Kill Platforms:} The original one to kill platforms one by one, and see how many applications left.

\item
\textbf{Game of Life:} Suppose the platform may meet some failure and lose some of its services (10 \%), but it has the ability to reboot this service, only after a short time period (0-10). An app dies if there is no platform to support it, and a platform dies after it has no application to support for a while (3). In such a configuration, a platform could act as another one's backup for a while, if they support the same application. The dissimilarities are between 0.5 and 0.7 .

\end{enumerate}




\section{Configuration}

Two configurations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{random:} Services are randomly distributed to each platform. The dissimilarity is quite high ( 0.92 - 0.95).

\item \textbf{mutated:} Randomly generate a number of seeds (3), and then each new platform is mutated from an existing one. It has a possibility to perform 0 to 3 times of mutation, each time to remove a service (10 \%), add new one (15\%), or change any of the existing one. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Base, dissims = 0.96

\item dep 300, dissims = 0.79
\item dep 400, dissims = 0.77
\item dep 500, dissims = 0.76
\end{enumerate}
